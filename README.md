Machine Learning: Decision Tree vs Logistic Regression


Many American cities have communal bike sharing stations where you can rent bicycles by the hour or day. Washington, D.C. is one of these cities. The District collects detailed data on the number of bicycles people rent by the hour and day.

Hadi Fanaee-T at the University of Porto compiled this data into a CSV file, which you'll be working with in this project. The file contains 17380 rows, with each row representing the number of bike rentals for a single hour of a single day. You can download the data from the University of California, Irvine's website. 

This short analysis is perfect to see the good and the bad of a Decision Tree Machine Learning Method. Meaning great results,  too specifically customised for the training set. Meaning overfitting, one of the most used words, and dangers, in Data Science.
